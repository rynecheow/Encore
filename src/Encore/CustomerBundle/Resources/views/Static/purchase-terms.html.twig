        <h3>Terms & Condition for Purchase</h3>

        <p>
            Before proceeding with your ticket purchase please read the Encore.com Terms and Conditions of Purchase (the

            Tickets are confirmed when full payment is received and when a confirmation e-mail together with an e-ticket
            is sent to you.
